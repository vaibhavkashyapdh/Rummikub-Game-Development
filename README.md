# Rummikub-Game-Development
Developed a fully-functional interactive Rummikub game using Python and Pygame, focusing on game logic, tile management, user interactions, and graphical presentation. The game replicates the popular tile-based game, allowing players to manipulate tiles, perform logical checks, and enjoy an engaging user experience through a clean, grid-based interface.

### **Key Features:**

- **Grid Rendering and Snap-to-Grid:** Implemented a dynamic 3D grid system to align tiles precisely, using functions for drawing grids and snapping tiles to specific grid positions to maintain spatial consistency.
- **Tile Management:** Designed a system for loading, displaying, and moving game tiles dynamically, with categorized tile groups by color and number for runs and sets detection. Enabled drag-and-drop tile movement with visual snapping and collision avoidance.
- **Game Logic and Validation:** Incorporated logic functions to identify valid runs and groups according to Rummikub rules, including checks for sequencing, grouping by color or number, and score updating. Provided automated verification of player moves using the check logic button.
- **User Interface Components:** Developed a customizable tile rack with interactive buttons for adding tiles, rearranging tiles by groups, colors, or runs, returning to the menu, and logic validation, all integrated with mouse event handling for seamless interaction.
- **Graphics and Assets Management:** Managed multiple image assets for tiles, backgrounds, and UI icons. Resized and positioned assets dynamically based on the game window size and states, maintaining visual clarity.
- **Modular Design:** Employed a modular code architecture with separated concerns — drawing grids, handling game mechanics, tile positioning, and UI components — fostering maintainability and scalability.

### **Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Pygame library for graphics and event handling
- Object-oriented programming for game state management
- Resource management via external image and font files

### **Impact:**

This project demonstrates skills in GUI application development, game logic implementation, image handling, and user interaction, suitable for portfolio showcasing advanced Python programming and game development capabilities.
